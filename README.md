* lessons display - the lessons are displayed using v-for to loop through the lessons so all 10 lessons can be displayed
* sorting functionality - the customer is able to sort lessons in ascending or descending order based on various attributes such as subject, price and location
* customers can add and remove lessons from the basket
* navigate between the lessons and checkout page
* customers can place orders using the checkout form - order details are stored in MongoDB orders collection through the backend REST API
